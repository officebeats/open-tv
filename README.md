## 🚀 The "Vibe Coded" Revolution

> "I tried to commit minor changes to the original repo but got dinged for 'vibe coding'. So I decided to take the vibes to the absolute limit."

Beats TV is a fork of [Open TV](https://github.com/fredolx/open-tv) that has been **100% vibe-coded and remixed using [Google Antigravity](https://github.com/google-deepmind/antigravity) and [Kilo Code](https://kilo.code) ✨ by a non-engineer.**

This project is a masterclass in modern **Agentic AI Coding**. It proves that with a strong aesthetic vision and the elite power of **Google Antigravity**, anyone can build world-class, premium software. No engineering degree required—just pure vision and elite vibes.
